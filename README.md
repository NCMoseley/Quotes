# Quotes on Dev Interactive Webpage

Quotes on Dev is a site used to experiment with Ajax, WP API, jQuery, and other cool things. 

This site is heavily inspired by Chris Coyierâ€™s Quotes on Design.

# README

I enjoyed the challenge of this project. I had many learning opportunities while using Jquery and also vanilla java to manipulate the DOM and pull array data in the correct format. I am now quite familiar with the wordpress template hierarchy, and I look forward to continuing to build with WordPress.
